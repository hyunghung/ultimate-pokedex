# Ultimate Pokedex

The virtual Pokedex for creating the ultimate team.

## Description
For the new and experienced Pokemon player. Whether you want a visual for dream Pokemon team, Ultimate Pokedex is your one-stop shop to create teams with your favorite Pokemon and hunders more which you may be unfamiliar with! Create an account using your desired email and password and start creating your team with our library of characters that range over multiple generations of Pokemon. 

## Installation 

For full code transparency, and access you will need to install a few packages before moving forward. 
Navigate to your command line and run 'npm install'. Once the install is successsful you will need to run 'npm i express'.


## Usage
Current use is allowing user to create an account and let them store teams of pokemon they have created on the site and let them acces i only when logged in. Should user deny creating an account or not loggin in they may only navigate the Pokedex and view character stats but they will not be allowed to create any teams. 
With Pokemon having a almost 30 years legacy as of this year. There is a massive fan base that stretches over many ages/generations. Ultimate Pokedex is for the user to get a visual on their favorite Pokemon game whether it be on a gameboy, console or card game. Cards have become a trend and many players are willing to buy expensive cards to add to their collection, when playing within a video game the particular Pokemon you may want can be time consuming. We hope to help the user make a decision before going out and investing their time and or money while pursuing a new Team.
